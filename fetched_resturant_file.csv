"Friendly staff, very accommodating, nice food.  Nice and cool inside in the air conditioning. Would be lovely outside on a winters day.",1
"Some of our party had cold chips with the fish and chip meal, well 3 of them, the fish was nice and hot though.",1
"This vineyard and restaurant is so lovely and welcoming! A beautiful location and the grounds are immaculately kept. The staff are friendly and very helpful, making one feel at ease. The food and wine were very good value for money. Our anniversary was such a great day because of the Barrel!",1
We had a great relaxing lunch - atmosphere was exactly what we wanted - staff are very helpful and friendly - food tasted great (not much of a selection) and the wine was fantastic ð¥,1
"Exceptionally friendly and welcoming staff delivering an efficient and quality service.

The wine tasting âflightsâ were well curated, we discovered some pleasing treats in the âpremiumâ and âreserveâ range.

Double grazing plate was good, nothing too adventurous for the price, but the quality of the ingredients used was very good.

The public holiday surcharge (15%) for food service was understandable, but it was also applied to take home wine bottle sales also. That to our mind was unconventional.

Overall a very good experience, and we will make the Barrel a regular haunt.",1
The food and service were great. Definitely worth the over 2 hour drive. Beautiful location,1
"We phoned ahead, made a booking, arrived at the restaurant 5 minutes early only to wait in the rain for 20 minutes before they found a table for us. It took 45 minutes for our meals to come out, which were disappointing in size and flavour. The waitress acted as if we were a total inconvenience to her day, and multiple waitresses had to get very close to us / stand over the top of us to see the table numbers which were written on scrap paper and sticky taped to the centre of the table. This occured with other diners meals, and our meals with the waitresses to other tables until their found ours. I've been looking forward to trying The Barrel for years, only to be left feeling disappointed with our experience.",0
Lovely food here! The setting is amazing dining inside a barrel. However the staff were completely overwhelmed with the busyness - waiters were delivering plates to the wrong tables and our meal took 1 hour to come out. Felt sorry for the staff as they did the best however it felt very manic.,1
Lovely location. Food came out one at a time and one meal didnât arrive at all. Generous portion sizes. Kids grazing platter was a nice idea. Staff not very friendly. Wouldnât go back.,0
Lovely afternoon at the Barrel.  Staff were really friendly.  Good and wine great!  Lovely setting.  Highly recommended.,1
We would love to see some live music outside to boost the ambience. We always have. A lovely time and we class it as our local.,1
Excellent selection of food and wine flights. Great day out,1
"Amazing atmosphere food was fresh and delicious, came out quickly after we ordered. Fabulous selection of drinks.",1
"The setting is inviting, shaded and is well spaced.  The service was prompt and efficient and the food very good.  I have no hesitation in recommending The Barrel to friends and visitors.",1
Fantastic food. Amazing selection of Wine and Beer. Highly Recommend!,1
"We have always wanted to visit The Barrel and so pleased we did! The beer and wine paddles were great and actually enjoyed every glass.The shared plate of cheeses,meats and dips was very yummy indeed ð",1
great food great atmosphere awesome place for any occasion great job to all staff at the Barrel,1
"Awesome value for money, really enjoyed a platter and wine flight.",1
"The location and vibe were really good but the food was pretty average, I had the driest, most rubbery piece of fish I've ever eaten and drinks were expensive.",1
"Staff were lovely, food and wine was great and the views/ atmosphere were the best! Would definitely recommend",1
"Our waitress was superb, making sure we were satisfied at every stage of our visit!",1
"Beautiful setting. Salmon was cold. Interesting service model for beverage, should just serve at bar rather than deliver",1
"Beautiful facility.  Staff lovely and friendly.  Food took an exceptionally long time to arrive, was not together (ate at diff times, entree came at end) and two meals missed.  The kitchen probably needs to update their systems or change them.  
Would also recommend putting wedding (Hens/bucks) parties in a different area to normal quieter guests.  You could create a wonderful charater space to accommodate.",1
"Great location, food was great, prices were very reasonable. Only issue was there was three bridal hen parties there at the same time as us. Everyone seemed to go and order at once so the queue for us to order was about 25 deep. They did eventually put an extra staff member on to speed the process.  There was however a couple of people who were not in the bridal parties pushed into the front of the line and they were immediately served by the staff which was very unfair to those waiting in the line.",1
"Great venue with fabulous decor and ambiance! Only issue was it was quiet cool, almost cold and on what was a cold, wet and dreary day, it was quiet uncomfortable! Food took a VERY long time to arrive and when it did they forgot a meal, however what we received was fresh and delicious!",1
"As neighbours we visit the Barrell regularly. Yesterday, the food and service was poor. We queued for 15 minutes to order a bottle of wine and 2 glasses, which took another 15 minutes to arrive. We both ordered fish and chips, which this time, was not to the Barrell's standard. It was heavy batter and not crisp. Service was unsupervised and did not seem to know what they were doing.",0
"We'd go back- but only for the food and wine.  The Service was weird!  We ordered our starter and main at the same time to save having to trot back to the counter and line up again, and they ARRIVED together!!!!  The young wait staff didn't seem to have any idea why that was weird and why we'd ask about it.
They've also missed a hug opportunity with the layout of this place.  The view over the back of the hills from the car-park is amazing... and it's a lot quieter over that side.  Seems odd that they'd have the diners sitting beside the main road when they could be enjoying the quiet and the view from the other side of the building.",1
"Food was great. Fairly quick to the table which is always excellent when you have a starving cyclist, runner and yogi. 

Service was great - we have dietary requirements so have questions and staff were friendly and helpful towards us and to help cater to our needs. 

Atmosphere was great. 

Overall 5 stars from me 
â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸",1
Lovely location and venue. Staff were all very friendly. Good food and wine.,1
"Very poor service, waited over 30 mins for drinks, no cutlery, napkins, follow up. Great spot but service is woeful.",0
Not enough staff to cope with number of guests. Had to ask 3 times to get the drinks we ordered and paid for did not get them until we finished lunch and were ready to leave. Food was not good and expensive.,0
"Absolutely terrible service !! Followed up our drinks with 4 different staff members (who were all rude) â¦..they ended up coming out nearly an hour after our food which was finished quickly and we were ready to leave when our drinks finally arrived.
Nice location, nice food, food area for kids to play however wonât be going back.",0
"Was such a lovely venue to visit. 
Beautiful position, great food, kids had a great time in the playground. 
Would go back again",1
"Reasonable food prices, very tasty, paddles and wines yum, really enjoyed bringing our interstate visitors here",1
"This was a great venue to meet up with friends on a warm spring day, and we had a lovely time. The service and food was fabulous. However, it did get a bit hot out in the sun and the umbrella didn't help much as the sun moved. I think heading into summer there might need to be further consideration of providing more shade in some areas.",1
"Absolutely fantastic service, beautiful food and great wine!",1
We had a wonderful lunch. As usual the chips were splendid. Everyone enjoyed their food. Both of us who ordered pasta felt like we were eating heaven - crab and prawn pasta and Mediterranean veg pasta. We will return.,1
"Perfect Anniversary gift for my parents. Wine, and beer paddles with two grazer platters, delicious. Telling my family and friends to visit. Well looked after. Really enjoyed our experience here.",1
"The Barrel was amazing from the great view with amazing food an wine 
The service was great 
staff were pleasant an welcoming",1
We have dined a few times at clouds and love it. However the food was not up to the usual standard,1
Service was bad. Wine and Food was average. Will not go back or recommend to anybody.,0
Waited 1.5hrs for our food to arrive then be told one of our dishes had sold out so one person didn't have a meal. Were offered to wait for a alternative meal but was not going to wait the length of time. Also 2 seperate drink orders were missed. Incredibly disappointed and not sure we would return,1
"Great venue, food, drinks, atmosphere and staff. Our second time here and will definitely be back! We attended on father's day which was very busy but staff handled it well and were all so welcoming and accommodating to our needs. Special thank you to Alicia who went out of her way to help our kids. All staff deserve a thank you!",1
"Waited around 80 minutes for main courses which then arrived across a 15 minute period. Staff were helpful and apologetic. Food, when we got it, was good.  Queuing to order food was painful - couldnât understand why the second register was closed when there were still loads of people ordering. It was the reason we didnât stay for dessert and coffee or purchase some wine to go.",1
"Very disappointed with our experience at The Barrel. Pre- booked a lunch for Fatherâs Day with my partner and 2 kids. I went up to order food and paid then was told we would be waiting an hour for our food! It took an hour and a half for food to come, just slapped down on the table no apologies for how late it was, then my meal was wrong and had to wait another 20 minutes for it to arrive (my partner had to prompt staff for it too), the linguine arrived but had no crab meat with it as stated on the menu. Drinks also took 20 minutes to arrive at our table. After finishing our meals we got up to look at the wines on offer to buy, we had left our kids books, colouring pieces and Lego on the table. When we got back to the table it was all cleared apart from the actual rubbish. Asked staff where our kids belongings were and was told in the bin at the bottom! Asked the lady if she could get them out as they were decent books and the Lego was collectors pieces, and she acted as if we were inconveniencing her! Whilst this was happening another customer was complaining about the wait time and incorrect meal. Really shouldnât have booked that many people in if they canât cope with the numbers.",0
"I politely complained twice about the awful fish and chips I received and had no empathy and no one apologised at all. The wait person said she would tell the chef but when I asked, she ignored it. The batter was absolutely awful and the one piece of fish was tiny and the table next to us received 4 pieces in what looked like a beautiful light batter. We had been looking forward to this for such a long time for Fathers Day and it was just really disappointing not to be acknowledged when I was already very apprehensive in complaining. Terrible experience.",0
"We ordered and waited 45minutes before asking how much longer the wait was. We were told another 30minutes with them unable to give an explanation as to why. 
After waiting another 30minutes we enquired as to where our food was and we were told there were still two dockets infront of us and that our food was yet to be started. 
As we had two very hungry small children with us and no clear indication of how much longer it was going to take for food to arrive we couldnât wait around any longer and left with a refund for our food. Was a very disappointing experience.",0
"Good service, once you order your food and drinks at the bar
Delicious food and good sizing 
Would prefer to be place in restaurant with the view of the mountains, compared to be in a dimmed light area",1
"Visited on Sunday 28th August with a group of 4 people.  Food was so tasty and awesome, wait was very reasonable for time of day & amount of people that where at the vineyard.  Unfortunately bar service was dreadful.  Waited over 30 mins for 2 schooners of beer, as we were told it was quicker for schooners rather than beer & wine paddles.  All food arrived at the table before drinks arrived.   Maybe a solution would to let people collect drinks from bar instead of full table service if staffing is an issue.  Seemed to be adequate staff at the restaurant.  Would definitely visit again.",1
"Have dined here before but we were very disappointed on Friday lunchtime when after queuing   met at the door, we had a table booked, to be told sorry but half hour wait till you get a drink and more waiting time for a meal.  We said to her that we'd cancel our table and we dined somewhere else.  Wished we'd known before driving there but we really enjoyed our second choice in Maleny.  When are you not so busy to serve.",0
"We waited an hpur for food, and the burger was raw, apparently only one chef on and he likes to undercook wagu burgers. No real apology or offer of refund, only offer of free desert or drink, which we declined. Would not recommend, nor would we return",0
Prawn an crab linguine was divine,1
On arriving we asked if we could be seated closer to the playground as we had two young children. We were told no as they only had bigger tables on that side which would have been fine if over half of them hadn't remainded empty the entire time we were there. There was no attmept to accomodate or request. We both had the thai beef salad which is usually a winner wherever we go. This time it just seem to be a bowl of rocket with a couple of token cherry tomatoes and pieces of red onion. There was barely any dressing and all seemed to be on the bottom of the bowl. The beef at least was tender. I was impressed with the childrens meals. We definitely got value for money with those. I had been thoroughly looking forward to finally trying out this resturant so I was sad to be so disappointed by it. I may go back again in the future but will definitely be trying other places out first.,0
"didn't honour booking, turned away when arrived. over 45mins before close",0
"THE BARREL  is on a perfect spot with great views and nature all around you. We had lunch there on Friday and the food was delicious. I had the Linguine with prawns & crab (very little crab!) and it was really delicious. My granddaughter loved her Hamburger (I think it was chicken) and her chips were to die for! The only downside was the slow service. We waited nearly 1 1/2 hours for our meal, even though the place wasn't overly busy. And the waitresses kept bringing the food to the wrong tables, which caused a bit of confusion. But we all know that restaurants are battling to get staff. So we will forgive them for the slow service as the delicious food made up for it. Well done chef!",1
"Location and look of the place is excellent. Food that was served tasted good. Unfortunately a lot of the menu was unavailable and the service was a little lacking. I tried to call the day before with a query and the phone line rang out. 
Appreciate that they were possibly understaffed and busy however most of our table had finished their meals before some other meals were served and the entree/dips that were meant to come out before the mains werenât delivered so we ended up cancelling them and a main meal as it was just too late. Sadly the main meal that didnât turn up was for the birthday person and was just salad so it was rather disappointing for their birthday.  
The outside toilets also have a smell that drifted to our table which was unpleasant. 
If the items on the menu we wanted had been available and if the meals had come out together I would rate higher. 
I have been before on a weekday in a big group and it was fine, however for a group booking on a weekend not so good.",0
"Made the booking for Lunch and when we got there, we were told that they did not have a Chef.",0
A bit disappointing for our 3rd visit here. The service was very slow. We ordered drinks well before our meals & the food came out first. Our pasta was just warm-cold by the time weâd finished. Disappointing as the meal was very tasty. The ambiance was very good but overall a very slow afternoon.,1
Service with a smile and ambience is what stood out.,1
"Friendly service although they had the technology for the menu and ordering via phone at table it wasnât in use on the day. Great place for families . 
Will go again on our next visit to Maleny.",1
"Food was delicious, we were seated by the playground which was great as we had a child but we kept getting whiffs of the toilets which wasnât very pleasant when trying to eat. Staff were nice. We had nearly finished eating before our wine/beer paddles came out. Not sure if they had forgotten about us. Overall it was a nice afternoon. Will definitely ask to be seated away from the toilets next time.",1
Beautiful spot to celebrate a birthday lunch.,1
Everything was beautiful except we found the toilets were not up to the standard of everything else.,1
"Pouring with rain, it was hard to get in or find the entrance. Once inside the restaurant was so quiet, no music or atmosphere. Ordered a cheese platter which was amazing. No knives provided so had to ask, but no cheese knives on site, only butter knife. 
Venue and food and wine amazing, let down by ambience and customer service. Staff not warm or friendly.",1
A great place to go and the decor is outstanding. Highly recommendd coming for a meal and tasting the local wines.,1
"Was busy with everyone having to order at the bar and only one staff member taking orders. Iâm thankful we didnât have a table inside where everyone was lining up as I found it a little awkward for the people sitting there. 
The vibe and seating area is beautiful the staff were friendly. We ordered the pastas and found them a little bland. I would go back for drinks and nibbles possibly but feel a better system in taking orders needs to be looked at.",1
We went for lunch. Food and service was very good. We sat outside with views of the garden which was really nice. Their wines were very good. We even bought some to bring home,1
"Had heard from multiple sources there had recently been a limited menu which was not great. I was surprised as having had lunch here 6 months back it was brilliant. If there was an issue itâs all sorted out as the full menu was on offer with a great variety of dishes. The crab and prawn pasta should be a signature dish. AMAZING!
Coupled with a wine flight is the best way to go. 
Keep it up guys, highly recommended.",1
"Good overall, the wine was tasty and it was a great experience to have wine tasting on your table with your food. 
There was only 3 vegetarian options, however there wasnât a massive choice for food in general. 
Mainly share plates, so a good place for wine and nibbles.",1
"Unfortunately there were a few errors and 'forgotten' items on our orders, otherwise a lovely day.",1
"Beautiful, child friendly venue. Great food & friendly staff!",1
We booked the Barrel Room for our Girlsâ Lunch. Fantastic area with amazing food. Highly recommend!,1
"Food was amazing!! 
Service was pretty average, my guess was understaffed. I rang 8 times over two days before getting through. The ambiance would have been so much better if they played any kind of music. Not much of a view either if thatâs what youâre after. But like I said, couldnât fault the food!",1
"Disorganised, wine was not local, from Stanthorpe. Platter was Woolworths products and not local. Disappointed.",1
"Wr had an absolutely lovely lunch experience, from the moment we arrived & were greeted by 2 lovely staff members, to quick ordering of our drinks & food. The wine tasting board was gr8 value for money, unftly no1 to explain wines to us tho, but the stand-up was the share platter of cheese, bread, crackers, cold cuts & condiments & also my partner juicy beef burgern with delicious fries! We would have no hesitation to go back",1
"Had a wonderful lunch, food service and wine were top notch !!
Great atmosphere and affordable menu !!
We will be back for sure with our friends !!",1
"Fabulous food, fantastic venue , we all loved it . Thank you!!!",1
"Beautiful spot, good food. Very enjoyable for weekend afternoon:-)",1
Can't respond properly as was not told that there was no cook  till we walked in for our birthday celebration  and had to find another venue.,0
Good set-up outside for catching up with friends whilst the kids play I. The playground.,1
The food was very undercooked. The fish my husband and sister has was pink and the batter was still soggy.,0
"They told us they were under staffed but that didn't slow the service. The staff were lovely and the service was quick. Great spot for families, with a fenced play ground",1
"A great way to spend a Sunday afternoon with friends.  We mainly had share plates with some drink paddles.  It would be great if there was some form of music either background or live entertainment.
Highly recommend a Sunday lunch at the Barrel!",1
"Unfortunately a few functions on and not enough staff members - our meals came and was eaten before our drinks and the drinks had to be prompted twice by us lining up to ask for them - once we were told they just were taken out and the second time saying they were already sent however have us new ones. 
Itâs a bit sad because I was really looking forward to this place and was just a bit of a let downâ¦ definitely need to hire more staff if there are going to be functions",0
Lovely local place to hang out with friends.  Best chips!,1
"We had a lovely lunch here.
The food was  nice and we especially lobed the kids grazing plate - what a great idea!",1
A fabulous venue to meet friends & enjoy quality food & drinks at good value prices. Would thoroughly recommend. We will return.,1
"I booked a table for my mothers birthday, they gave us our own room without even asking, the staff were warm, welcoming and friendly throughout our whole time there. The drinks were very well priced and delicious. The food was much the same, after we ordered it wasnât long at all before they brought it it out and it was also very well priced and delicious. All the meals were great with the Prawn Cesar salad as the clear winner. I would definitely go back, we all had our fill of drinks and food and it still came in under $50 a head.  Great place.",1
Service was friendly and fast! My partner and I both had the chicken creamy pasta which was lacking flavour but the garlic bread was great. Would still go back!,1
"We had a wonderful time, we thought we would have a person to tell us about the wines, it was very busy and staff were overwhelmed. We enjoyed ourselves.",1
"Overcooked fish, disinterested staff, and very dirty rest rooms. Unfortunately Clouds Vineyards felt like a cheap cafe when it could have been so much more. The weekday menu was extremely limited and uninteresting. I wonât be taking interstate visitors to the Barrel cafe for a very long time.",0
Service was very poor - restaurant always seems to be understaffed and you wait extremely long amounts of time for coffees/ drinks,1
"Delicious, value for money food! Friendly service and a lovely spot to enjoy a few drinks âºï¸ð¾",1
30th wedding anniversary weekend get away,1
"If you are going for just the wines, you will be happy...they are very good & the Chardonnay was one of the nicest, I have tried in a long time.
If you are going for the views, you will be disappointed; as the whole place seems to be facing the wrong way...why are the best views from the carpark as your driving out??!
If you are going for impeccable service, well...our (older) waitress was lovely & couldn't do enough for us.  The tables surrounding us were being ""serviced"" by a younger darker haired girl & I was appalled by the way in which she spoke to the other customers. She was arguing with (all of) them, that they had moved tables after ordering...& hadn't placed orders, when they actually had etc.  She was just a complete A Grader to everyone on that day & should not be in this industry!  Sorry, but a necessary truth.
If you are going for the food...just order from the wine list! ð",0
We were not sure if we ordered at the counter or table service. We did have a booking and were seated with menus but not informed of the procedure. I had the salmon which was over cooked but still nice and my partner had the Pasta which was quite basic in flavour. I would recommend a friend visiting but maybe not for a meal.,1
"Met family while back over in Australia , was a lovely atmosphere and food was good , would definately recommend to others, although closure at 4pm and wouldnât serve a final drink at 3:40 but apart from that it was a lovely day",1
Other than waiting over and hour for food everything else was great. Would like to go back when they arenât as busy,1
We booked at 12:30 and were given an outside table. We waited over an hour for our food with no follow up by staff. When it came the burgers were cold as was the warm beef salad. The fish was tasteless. No one came to check on our outside table when it started to rain. There was a further wait if you wanted dessert so we left. Very sad experience.,0
Lovely picturesque venue to enjoy a delicious lunch and drinks with the family. The service was not the friendliest and could be improved..,1
Thank you for looking after us yesterday - one of us was local the other 2 from Toowoomba.  The Symphony Hill Pinot Gris was a big hit.  I have already recommended the winery to others travelling that way.,1
"Cannot fault the food, serving size was more than generous, and very tasty.the level of service left alot to be desired, my family group was addressed as
 ""you people"" .... I thought I had become a cast member of Seinfeld! 

I was researching venues for a function later in the year , but just handing me a card and saying go look for yourself is not selling me on service.",0
"The Barrel is a âmust goâ.
The dining room and outdoor dining options provide for the needs of a wonderfully varied range of diners. Thank you for having us.",1
"We ordered cheese platters to start but these came out after the meals so wended up taking this home which was very disappointing. 
We were 2 parties and the meals came out very muddled and also drinks came out last.. 
very poor service unfortunately",1
Great setting that works well for a young family.  Great service and friendly staff.,1
Lovely meals in a wonderful setting. Great lunch had by all at our table. Staff friendly and efficient.,1
"The food was very good. My sister and I shared the grazing platter, my father had the fish and chips and nephew had the chicken burger. The Symphony Hill Pinot Gris was a nice wine and well priced for a restaurant. 
Everyone very friendly. Only one complaint which was minor. It took about 20 minutes to get our wine. 
Lovely day out and will definitely be back.",1
Slow service due to totally under staffed. Not the first time,1
"Pleasant atmosphere, good food at a reasonable price.  Outdoor settings with plenty of space and family friendly area for children.",1
"We had a lovely time at the Barrell. It was a shame that the table QR code ordering was unavailable, because there was a long line to order, but that was the only complaint.",1
Unfortunately our meals all arrived at different times and most were cold. Beautiful venue just a bit disappointing with the food.,1
Good pub food and pleasant surroundings,1
"The best big breakfast I have ever had, highly recommended",1
My parents were up visiting from Tassie and we thought we would take them out for lunch to a QLD winery. We were VERY disappointed. We were shown into a back room and told to order from the QR code (which in the end didn't work and we had to stand in a long line to order). No staff interaction. Wines on the tasting paddle we're just plonked in front of us with no explanation. Lamb rump was extremely tough and inedible. Seafood pasta was bland and tasteless. The pumpkin and Thai beef salad was ok but again very average. We weren't checked on by one staff member throughout our visit and upon leaving NOONE even acknowledged us. The venue it's self was nice and the wine barrel is very effective.,0
The food is always amazing. Itâs a favourite spot of ours to celebrate family birthdays. The fenced playground and outdoor chess set are a hit. We booked outside but with the weather a little funny they kindly had already prepared a table for us inside. Thank you!,1
Relaxed atmosphere & wonderful food,1
My friends and I had a lovely time at The Barrel. Great wines and delicious food....a great place to spend a Sunday afternoon,1
"Always a high standard at The Barrell. It's a known quality and great value. Friendly, proffesional staff. Beautugul views!",1
We pop in often and take Advantage of this Amazing place.,1
Really good spot took my partner had a great time and great service,1
Lovely spot.  Shame they do not take advantage of the view of the Glasshouse Mountains with a deck at the back.  Portion size of meals are small considering the price.  But meals were nice.  Loved the deserts.,1
"Booked online 3 weeks ahead and confirmed the day prior, however, staff could not find any booking on our arrival. Fortunately we were able to be seated in the cellar room which had a great feel. I think it was more luck than anything else as there were 13 of us. 
At the end of the lovely meal we asked for the surprise birthday cake to be brought in. Would have been nice if staff had lit the candles and then brought it in, rather, they just brought the cake box in and sat it on the table. 
Just a little more care and attentiveness would have earned them a higher rating.",1
Always enjoy my visit to the Barrel. The staff are always friendly and the atmosphere is always great.,1
"Lovely restaurant with shady outdoor eating areas. The food was extremely good. Unfortunately they didn't have all menu items available for purchase and the QR table service app could have been good, it didn't allow you to make any changes to the menu eg. no cheese, so was a bit useless to us. Having said all that, I'd dine here again as the food we had was delicious and the shady outdoor area was great on a very hot day.",1
Very tasty food and lovely atmosphere. Worth while place to visit and dine,1
Over priced and under serviced. Wines were disappointing and the food was very overpriced and the service was of poor quality.,0
Great location. Fun for adults and kids! Will be back.,1
"Cracking venue awesome views average to good food 
Service ok",1
"Lovely venue with a nice atmosphere,  staff are lovely and food is exceptional.  I highly reccomend this venue",1
"Such a beautiful place, amazing food and for someone who does like any wine other than moscato usually, I liked every single wine that we tried.",1
"Lovely spot but unfortunately was very disappointed. No one to greet customers at entry or check vaccination status. Booked for 3rd January, and on trying to make order on app, only to find out they had run out of burgers & chips, at 1pm  plus had to ask for menu & water. We decided to go elsewhere to eat. Sadly cannot recommend and will not go back, unless new management/owners.  It is a goldmine of a place with much potential. How could they get it so wrong?",0
"Ordered a Thai Beef Warm salad, but it seems it came straight out of the fridge as it was stone coldâ¦. The Stout beer I ordered was flatâ¦",1
"Kicking off the New Year with family, had a fabulous brunch at the Barrel.  Food was amazing & serving size excellent for the price.  The only downside was it was raining so we could not share the outdoor experience of the venue with our fur child, so we will definitely be back again. The staff communication with regard to the weather on the day was great & very much appreciated. Will also be back with friends to take on more of the wine/beer tasting side of things.",1
"Amazing food, great service. Can't wait to go again",1
"Great food, great service, great position.
Will definitely return again",1
We thoroughly enjoyed our day! The food was great however Mum had the Thai Beef Salad and the Beef was over cooked and was very tough. Overall though we really enjoyed the day snd recommend it. Thank you.,1
"Really enjoyed the Barrell, the Nori was delicious, will definitely be back.",1
Love the wine! Service amazing. Atmosphere outstanding. A must do!,1
Great spot for a relaxed lunch with family or friends,1
Have been here several times for lunch. Food has always been superb. Good value for money as are the wines   The staff are extremely friendly and helpful.,1
We enjoyed the sunny ambiance of well presented surroundings together with efficient service and great food. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the experience in the same way we did. The Barrell will continue to be a regular destination for us when we need that special break from our daily living pattern.,1
"Had a very pleasant experience, it was so nice to see Santa Clause.",1
The atmosphere was magic Service excellent food was enjoyable but noise was overpowering due to a large party Next time we would ask to be seated outside,1
"As soon as I walked in I new we were going to have an amazing afternoon. The venue itself is immaculate, the gardens were beautiful, kids area was very welcoming and the vibe was just calming. The service was great and food was good. We all had a wonderful time!",1
"A wonderful venue and setting with a relaxed ambience, we had a really enjoyable and memorable time with friends. Some great views overlook the Glasshouse Mountains, with picturesque indoor and outdoor spaces, including the adjacent vineyard. Thank you to Clouds for providing this unique experience.",1
The staff were friendly and obliging. The food was great.  We sat inside so the noise was noticeable but my husband has hearing sensitivity so not the problem of the venue necessarily!,1
Generally a great venue. Let down on part of the food today. Fried chips very poor quality.,1
Have been there several times and always a good experience. Interstate visitors have commented is a good place to dine.,1
Our party of four each had the fish and chips meal. Whilst the meal was very nice we felt that it was a bit pricey at $24. The service was good and the staff friendly.,1
Delicious food and a tranquil setting. My partner and I both thoroughly enjoyed our meals- the salmon and prawn & crab pasta. Meals came out extremely quickly.,1
A great way to start my tours. Always a pleasure. Everyone of my guests so far have loved The Barrel.,1
Great variety on the menu to eat for lunch not the usual hamburger and chips.,1
"As locals we have been very much enjoying the Barrel for lunches with our friends.
A good menu, friendly staff, plenty of parking so we don't have the problem of finding a car park in the middle of Maleny. Many thanks Clouds.",1
What a beautiful spot. Perfect for kids with the playground! Loved it. A must to go to,1
"Second time dining here. The food is simple but delicious, cooked perfectly.
The beer paddle is worth trying - loved the ginger beer!
Would love a deck out the back to take full advantage of the view.
We will definitely be back",1
"Very nice setting, the barrel is well done. Great selection of wines and beers. Food was very nice too. Would go again.",1
"Lovely location, the outside atmosphere is amazing and drink paddles are got value, but food was ordinary.",1
"Great venue & the view was lovely. 
Also thoroughly enjoyed the wine & cheese platter.",1
"Took a little getting used to with electronic service but it was worth it. When you say you are happy to sit outside make sure you ask to be away from the playground. Be mindful of the heat of the sun too. Food, drinks, staff - absolutely fabulous!!! Would definitely go there every time we are in the area. Service was seriously super quick and the view/location is thumbs up.",1
Have been there several times this year.  Have always been happy with the lovely Gourmet meals and service.  Lovely venue also and very pleasant outside.,1
"Very poor service from all staff on Sunday. Which was disappointing being Fatherâs Day.
Food was terrible. Pasta was cold and also not the pasta I ordered, didnât say anything to staff due to rude service didnât feel comfortable enough to voice this to them. 
Wine was great but didnât make up for the rude wait staff and terrible food.",0
"Looks beautiful but sat inside the barrel, no views at all, had to find our own table we had booked no one was checking us in, ordered through code at table didn't go through had to reorder at bar, table behind too close, had to move ours as couldn't chair out, toilets tiny and not clean, I can see potential but not there yet, hopefully with the works going on there will be a view, not enough parking, road at top so busy fast, no walkway to restaurant down driveway without walking on entry rd, with little kids not great",1
Great spot to enjoy either indoor or outdoor eating and drinks. Parking is being extended which is good. Best fish and chips eaten in a long while!,1
"Possibly needed slightly louder music, more furnishings but will be back as it was overall quite good. 
Just needed more atmosphere.",1
"Good service and beautiful outside on a good day.  Great bar.
The salmon was amazing however too much stringy rocket was inedible.

I made a booking and was surprised to be put in a shady side area which was too cold and perhaps the worst table on the property.

However, we will come again and we do enjoy the ambience.",1
"Our experience on arrival was hectic staff did not take the time to greet us to busy cleaning tables.
Time lapsed and finally a team member said l  will be with you shortly.

In the mean time we found a table an sat down 

About 15 minutes later we were offered water by this time we had already ordered our first round oft drinks

Finally menus had been provided to us and simple ordering instructions 

The food was awesome pity about the staff attentive",1
"Nice place....was offered no water to begin with and ordered the cheese platter as entree and came out after thr main...so didn't really want it but had already paid for it unfortunately...
Would be nicer if there was table service...
Staff are polite...
Maybe needs more tables spaced apart",1
Fabulous experience after a hard couple of years working hard and renovating on top of full time work it was an incredible place to chill unwind and destress. Food was so yummy drinks fabulous and the young man who spoke to us there what a delightful guy. I would have him in my business in a heartbeat what an asset to the place he was a gem. Walked around took in the magnificent views sipped on red wine smooth and silky i was in my happy place. My husband looked like the weight of the world had been lifted off his shoulders and thats a hard one to achieve. I give this place 11 out of 10 we wii be back.,1
At our visit to Clouds we found them to provide Friendly service and the place had great atmosphere,1
"Great wines, fantastic food and lovely spot to relax.",1
"While the food, drinks and service were all top notch we were seated near a large group of men and women who were dropping the F bomb extremely loudly while describing their interactions with other people. We quickly ate our food and took our drinks to different section to enjoy without having yo listen to the F word said repeatedly and loudly. Such a shame as Iâd taken my partner their as part of his special birthday celebrations. In hindsight I should have asked to be moved but Iâd booked a table in that cute semi private barrel shaped room. But as mentioned earlier the grazing platters were delicious.",1
"Great food, friendly staff and we ladies were in the back room â¦ brilliant!",1
"Food was great, service was poor with a very grumpy waitress not friendly and very unhelpful.  However we will be back as we have been there a few times and it has always been great. I just wanted to let you know",1
"Food was delicious. Chips were perfect. Burger was a bit lacklustre. 
Wine flight was nice and would recommend to friends to try this out. Also tried the house Shiraz and have to say 10/10",1
Super friendly staff. Yum and well priced food and a good range of drinks.,1
"Ordering was made easy from barcode on table, fast service and delicious food.  Sat in the middle of the barrel room and was very pleasant.  Will definitely be back.",1
"My all time favourite place. Service is always top notch, food is next level everytime and the drinks are delicious.",1
"Great food, and really enjoyed it both the wine and beer samplers .

Great service, although a bit slow only because it was busy. Worth the wait though.

View outside amazing especially from the car park",1
Very relaxing enviroment.Staff were attentive but not intrusive.Will come again,1
"The best restaurant that we have been to in a very long time, the kids play area is great and the food sensational.",1
"Came for Motherâs Day, wine was amazing, food was terrible, chips are so oily and cold, we ordered a cheese and cold meat platter for entree which came out with the mains and the staff didnât want to do anything about it, just plonked it down on the table and walked off. Our table was sat no more then 30 cm from the one next to us so it felt like we were sitting having lunch with them. I booked in advance, and didnât get a nice table outside. Will I return? No, probably not. Such a shame, and as a fellow employee of the hospitality industry can I just say the staff really could do with more training, and maybe hire a chef for the kitchen?",0
We will be back. Great place to meet up with friends.,1
"We were told we could either use the online menu app or counter service. Probably would have expected table service.  We found out after waiting a while for drinks that the online app had not sent our order through. We ordered an entree but while eating it the main course came which was a little disappointing. We prefer entree irst then main course following which is the norm.
Overall very nice place and food excellent",1
We love the Barrel. Itâs our new favourite spot to have lunch and some drinks.,1
It was the worse experience here in Australia. We made the reservation I think one week  before and when we arrived we ordered and one hour and half later 2 plates were placed in our table and 15 mins later another another 2 plates arrived... 20 mins   Another 2 plates and the last two arrived when we 6 finished the food. Thatâs an incredible bad service if we order together we should receive the food together. We couldnât have a glass of wine together and celebrate the birthday. The manager just said Iâm sorry we are too busy but itâs not our fault because they expect the visit of the people who made a reservation. Bad bad experience,0
Lovely venue and friendly staff however we were a little disappointed that there was so much we couldnât order from the menu due to meals being sold out. We did go for lunch on a Monday public holiday so they might have run out from being slammed on the weekend. I think our ratings would have been higher if we could have ordered what we wanted as it was my husbands birthday.,1
"The wine taster flights were okay, but our cheese board took 35 minutes to arrive and our mains (pasta and lamb) took another 1 hour 5 min to arrive. When they did arrive they tasted microwaved, overcooked and certainly not worth the price or the wait. We were thoroughly disappointed with the over-priced food and the long wait - we would have left without receiving our food, except that ordering is done through an app and was already paid for. When the food was finally brought out we were not offered an apology or explanation. Unfortunately this lunch was the worst part of our anniversary trip.",0
Lovely location with beautiful outdoor seating. Friendly and prompt service. Devine food and great wine!,1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch sitting outside in the beautiful sunlit garden & bought 2 bottles wine for home.
Will definitely be back to experience other food on the menu.",1
"Delicious wine!!!! Oh yum! Get a tasting paddle for sure. Food was tasty, especially the pumpkin and haloumi salad. Staff were run off their feet when we were there - very busy, maybe under-staffed? Beautiful view of Glasshouse Mts, wish there was dining out the back to enjoy this view. Well done to the gardener as well for gorgeous hedges. Thoroughly recommend!",1
"The waitress was lovely however having to order and pay via scanning in a fine dining restaurant is appalling! Every extra drink ordered had to be ordered through the app which was time consuming, impersonal and really cheapened the experience. Bring back good old fashioned customer service! 
The lamb was lovely but a very small serve and for the price they should give more than two very thin slices but flavour was lovely. 
Burgers and chips were nice and beef was too. We all enjoyed the food. Inside was very noisy so we decided to move outdoors instead 
Overall nice place and good food",1
"We had a lovely time. Food was good and the atmosphere was nice. Service was friendly and the wine was good. Great for family as well. 
No complaints.",1
Clouds Vineyard-The Barrel is an excellent venue for Lunch.  The service is excellent and the food and wine are very good.  We also find it reasonably priced.  We enjoyed our Sunday Lunch and will definitely rebook when the opportunity arises.,1
"Has a great time celebrating a birthday. Live music was a little too loud inside, making it hard to hear Conversations.",1
We have been to The Barrel several times and the food has always been wonderful. Very well priced and so are the wines. The staff are always very sociable and easygoing. Very hard working and eager to please. Got our  recommendation!!,1
"Great service, delicious food and lovely atmosphere.  Highly recommend :)",1
The food was excellent and the service was great.   Friendly and very helpful staff.,1
"I am a local and hadnât been to the Barrel since the new ownership and refurbishment.
Went on a rainy day for a casual lunch catch-up with old friends and it was the perfect place! It is counter service and the wait and bar staff were friendly and helpful. 

Our meals came out in a timely fashion and were well presented and fresh ingredients. The meals were very large serves. You can try paddles of the local wine also.

We enjoyed our meal and would certainly go back again.",1
"Beautiful spot, child friendly. 
Fantastic local beer and wine.

Some dishes to highly priced. Eg. calamari 

Will be back.",1
"We arrived at a very busy time 1pm Saturday and it was difficult to find anyone to talk to about reservation etc we found our table, found our own menu and lined up for 15 minutes to order. This means one person sits at table waiting for 15min on own.
We were next to items for sale so had people standing next to our table several times. It was noisy with people having fun.",0
"We had the $65 per person lunch and it was wonderful. The food was very tasty, appealing to look at and very good value. We were glad not to have eaten breakfast as there was a lot of nutritious food on offer. We highly recommend this restaurant.",1
"Food was nice, some tasty local dishes, some that you would expect as a cheap side dish (Tomatoes, cucumber and feta - classed as a dish for the restaurant but Iâd say this is a cheap garnish). Time between dishes took a while for some of them. Paper table cloths are not the way forward!! Feel gross and do not look nice.

Service was a bit all over the place, run by friendly but inexperienced staff. Walking through small table gaps when there are larger walkways, talking loudly, different person every couple of minutes. Not seamless when paying above $250 for a meal",1
Food spectacular as usual..big shout out for BRIANNA..a natural waitress with a pleasant nature! (She's a keeper!)..kudos to her mentor as well..overall fantastic..the reason it's mum & i's go to indulgence! Gav,1
"Friendly and attentive service team, exquisite meals and a beautiful view. We picked the feed me like a Barossan option and found it to be incredibly good value. Plentiful food, all equally delicious and well-presented.",1
Absolutely beautiful lunch. Fresh and incredibly tasty. Will certainly be back to sit and enjoy an amazing view and amazing food!,1
"Great food with lots of variety, love the concept of shared plates.",1
Food was absolutely delicious and the service was fantastic,1
The whole table has to agree to the menu and there was no flexibility apart from vegetarian options and we asked if we could pair and told no!! So unless you all have similar tastes for dinner forget this place!,1
Absolutely perfect in every way. Love spending time at Harvest Kitchen ðð,1
Harvest Kitchen has always been a great place with amazing food but unfortunately this seems to have changed over the past 6 months. The prices have gone up and the quality and portion size of food has dropped. For this reason I don't think it will be worth the trip with so many other incredible restaurants in the area.,1
Delicious and enjoyable. Would recommend and would go back.,1
"If you have Dietary Requirements, very accommodating if you do the Tasting Menus.  I have Coeliac Disease and had no repercussions and was very well looked after â¦ Thank you to the kitchen ð",1
"We  love coming back.  Beautiful setting,  amazing food and friendly service. Thank you",1
"Delicious, friendly, accommodating we will definitely come back",1
Food is outstanding! Service excellent. Locally sourced and delicious.,1
"Beautiful winery views, service and food was amazing, would recommend and come back",1
"Food was seasonal and delicious. Service was great, attentive, but not over the top. Views and ambience are great. Well worth it for a special meal out.",1
"Lovely views from dining room and balcony. Nice lawn area for kids to run about. Had chefâs choice. Beautiful, fresh and filling. Wonderful friendly wait staff and knowledgeable tasting staff too. A must do for a leisurely lunch!",1
Beautiful venue with amazing views and the food was so delicious. The staff were so lovely and accommodating also!,1
"Delicious food in beautiful, green and serene surroundings. A must when visiting the Barossa",1
"THE go to place when at the Barossa. Great location, great food, great service.",1
"Up to the usual standard, excellent.",1
Wonderful service and food each time we visit. Thank you,1
"sometimes we were left waiting for a while between serves - we were not fully briefed that only some things from the menu would be served to us, not all on the listed menu.",1
The food was fresh vibrant and ample and they catered amazingly for our GF diner,1
"An outstanding dining experience. Delicious food with perfectly sized portions. We went the Feed Me Eden option and had a variety of dishes to choose from. Still had room for a dessert. Standout dishes that provided a unique dining experience were the Sweet Corn ribs and salted caramel, vanilla ice cream with toffee popcorn dessert. Staff were friendly and prompt with service. Amazingly sunset.",1
"Excellent table service, lovely mix of flavours and portion size.",1
"Amazing location, delicious food and exceptional service. Definitely recommend.",1
"Amazing, tasty food, well paced and well portioned. Can't reminder our waiter's name but she was fab.",1
"The scenery at Harvest Kitchen is sublime, our main waiter James was very engaging and hospitable the food was fresh and ample and we had a wonderful dining experience.",1
From Western Australia.  Second time here.  Will come again!,1
Booked for outdoor dining however on arrival was told nothing available and was sent inside and told if anything become available we would be shifted. We were in front of the bar with plenty of traffic around. After sitting down for 5 minutes two tables cleared outside and one of them was not used for the time we were there. Had to ask for additional drinks after 10 minutes despite several staff walking past multiple times and food that came out was not what we ordered. In saying this the food was excellent,1
"We can't praise this venue enough, enjoyed an amazing meal ( Eat like a Barossan) drank local wines and soaked in the magnificent view. 
Staff were friendly and welcoming. 
Our guests from interstate were very impressed.
We will be returning!! 
Great job guys, compliments to the chef.",1
The steak we had as part of our set menu was extremely bloody and very tough. Outside of that. Everything else was amazing!,1
"An amazing meal experience. Delicious flavours cooked to perfection. Dog friendly down on the patio (tell them you have a dog when you book) with a beautiful outlook and beanbags on the lawn to relax on after. 

Very busy. But very well run. Well worth a stop.",1
"I take a lot of tours through South Australia wine regions and this would have to be one of the best restaurant/wineries in the state.  The service is great, the staff are wonderful to deal with, beautiful views just a really great place to relax and enjoy what the barossa has to offer.",1
"Outside is fantastic on a hot,  but not too windy day. We booked for outside but on arrivals was told there was no table. However they said as soon as one became available they would move us...and they did. Much appreciated",1
Our waitress was absolutely amazing! Will definitely be back!,1
A must visit for anyone planning a Barossa experience,1
"Fantastic food and service, just a shame we had to finish our meal at another table due to a follow on booking (2 hr seating).",1
Fresh & delicious food complimented by cheerful and attentive service. The setting of the restaurant and the ambiance was lovely!,1
"Outstanding, beautiful food, wine and location. Feed me (us) like a Barossan is an experience weâd like to not share, cause we want a seat available when we book ð Best kept secret in the valley.",1
"We keep returning! ð The food is superb, service is outstanding and the view is magnificent!! 
Thanks for making this an amazing dining experience ð¥°",1
Fantastic wine and food! The quality was amazing. Our only complaint was that the service was a bit slow and the staff not as attentive as they could be. Had to ask for water twice on a very hot day. staff did not ask if we wanted more drinks either which I thought was odd.,1
"Great to take the kids. Ate on the balcony, then played on the grass afterwards. Had the $65 per head menu, was delicious. Kids menu was also great. Amazing service. Will be back for sure!",1
Went with the âFeed me like a Barossanâ option and wasnât disappointed. Great selections and excellent service,1
"The service was amazing, the food was delicious but maybe a little more generous with things like the pita bread etc.",1
"Food was lovely however the portions were small. The atmosphere and surroundings were lovely, very family friendly and the staff were very attentive and helpful",1
Initial greeting and ensuing table service was excellent. Food good but would have liked more meat dishes. Great to have food intolerances addressed well.,1
We look forward to our yearly lunch at harvest kitchen it never disappoints.  Anyone I know visiting Barossa Valley are all encouraged to go there with rave reviews from them all.,1
"We had a wonderful day celebrating our 33rd wedding anniversary. Great weather to sit out on the deck,  looking at the beautiful scenery. We ate like a Barossan & really enjoyed everything that was served. We would happily return for a special occasion in the future.",1
"This was a surprise find as Harvest Kitchenâs menu is not your typical lunch with interesting dishes. Some of the dishes such as the Braised Hutton Vale Lamb was tad bit salty for our liking but the rest were really good especially the corn ribs, yummms!!! Do drop by at least once if ever you are in Barossa.",1
"Great food, great service and great atmosphere.",1
"Visited post Xmas, place was full and vibe good in a sunny afternoon - seated on deck which was great but wouldnât want to have been much warmer.  Food very good with Chefs 5 course platter, small deduction as one course (squid) wasnât quite hot enough but flavours excellent .  Good local wines to match - Calabrian Cab Sav a stand out.",1
We opted for feed us like barossian but couldnt actually distinguish if it was any different from normal menu. Every serving we had was from normal menu. Serving size was a bit small for a group of six.,1
"Experience of eating at Harvest Kitchen is just amazing.
The staff is so welcoming and cheerful.
Service is excellent and food was very fresh and tasty!!",1
"A great setting overlooking the vines towards TANUNDA. Food was innovative and fresh, staff were very friendly and unobtrusively, they were also knowledgeable on the menus and wine list. We will be back shortly.",1
"This was my third visit this year, each time I have brought a new person with me.
Not one of them has been disappointed 
Thank you",1
Tasty food with a difference. Friendly service. Great view from the balcony.,1
"Always amazing everytime I book 
Food is just amazing",1
Great food - excellent wine list. Gorgeous views and friendly staff - a wonderful experience overall.,1
"Food was delicious, view was beautiful and very good value",1
The staff are amazing and very helpful. The food is outstanding! A must visit!,1
"We have previously been to Harvest Kitchen and really, really enjoyed it so we thought we would go again. We did enjoy it and the service was great, but the food and the ambience wasn't quite how we remembered. Granted, it was a rainy day this time rather than sunny, but it was freezing cold in the restaurant and the tables were really packed in. Some of the food was great and other dishes not so great- this time the rare steak dish was incredibly chewy and was a struggle to finish. The wine recommended was also much heavier than we had asked for. The service was great though- we saw a dish we liked that someone else was getting and they added that to our ""Feed Me Like a Barossan"" menu. All in all it was good, not as good as we remembered though and we would perhaps choose somewhere else next time on a rainy day- this is definitely a restaurant best enjoyed on a sunny day outside with a rose, rather than inside which lacked ambience.",1
"The food was exceptional 10/10.  I would recommend anyone come and dine here for expectional food and value, and the wine list was also good.

There was a little confusion about who was going to be our waiter/waitress initially, we were told one young lady, and then a young gentleman, but then we were tended to by a young lady afterall. Our second drinks order was forgotten, and then we ordered it again. Overall, service was friendly and very professional, but not as well organized perhaps as it could have been. 

Hands down great food and value, and good service overall, just a few hiccups there.",1
"The service was friendly, efficient & well-timed between courses.
The outlook across the vineyards from the restaurant is pleasant.
The available food was varied, delicious & appealingly served.
We enjoyed the Calabria wines - Chardonnay, Riesling & Rose.",1
"Absolutely amazing and unusual food, beautifully presented.",1
"The food portions feel like they are smaller than they used to be and the price hasn't gotten any cheaper, although the quality is still good.  The food was pushed out a bit too quickly by the kitchen, and the service staff weren't the most engaging compared to previous visits.  We're probably not going to rush back after this visit, but we would go back at some point.",1
"Delicious Food, lovely setting, great service, fabulous day",1
"Went here with my daughter and 4 year old grandsonâ¦ very accommodating for children with puzzles etc â¦

We selected from the $55 pp â¦ and had the old vine Shiraz â¦ very reasonable prices for wine

Cannot fault at all â¦. Food, service and settingâ¦.

Having been to Penfolds Magill Estate and it was on par at half the cost

I donât know who is responsible for the day to day running but congratulations",1
"Once again, I enjoyed a magnificent lunch.
Excellent food, although I did choose , maybe, one or two more courses than I needed, but what the heck!
Service, quietly done and very attentive.
The view is always great.",1
Amazing food and excellent service. Wine was very nice too.,1
Food was amazing! Service was great! Venue is stunning! Could not fault,1
Could not ask for move â¦. Food excellent and service outstanding,1
Love this restaurant...the food is superb....but ....enclosed on a very hot day... understand why but it was very noisy...and...we felt the service was a little bit rushed ..so felt a little more like a cafeteria rather than the classy restaurant it is.,1
Go and enjoy fantastic food whilst taking an a fantastic outlook!,1
"once again, we had the feed me.  food was delicious, just the right amount and very timely.  catered to our non meat eater.  would def visit again",1
"Great food, customer service and excellent value for money. Will be back!",1
"Had interstate guests over for business and they were very impressed, food was amazing. Canât fault the service either and we were running late but wasnât an issue and the staff were happy to accommodate which was really appreciative.",1
Food was outstanding. Innovative flavours and presentation but not fussy or pretentious. Servings perfect size so we had more than sufficient but not too much. Lovely outlook of the vineyard on the veranda. Staff incredibly helpful and welcoming,1
"Great food, friendly service and wonderful setting and views.",1
good food and service excellent however food took a long time - was seated at 12:45 and food only finished coming at nearly 3 pm! Good lunch but slow lunch.,1
Spectacular. As a coeliac the nicest restaurant meal I have had in a long term and absolutely careful of my dietary needs.,1
"Spectacular!
Every dish was amazing and every single one of was fed very well like a Barossan!
Service was great, and wine was amazing. Absolutely loved it!",1
Adored everything about this place. We will be back. Highly recommend.,1
"Have been to Harvest Kitchen a few times now and always enjoy the food plus beautiful scenery. We have had some Birthday meals here with family, always enjoy the wine as well.",1
"We had a great meal at Harvest Kitchen last night. We had the Barossan, where the chef makes the choices from the 5 courses. They were all excellent, and there was a good choice of wine too. Staff were friendly and helpful.",1
We had a lovely night. Is a great way to show off Barossa veiws. Will definitely be back,1
Sunset view over the vines would have been wonderful except for the showers and strong winds. Meal was exceptional.,1
"Great good, service, view. Always a great experience",1
Never thought that being 'fed like a Barossan' meant dish after dish of vegetables.,1
Lovely food & variety of flavours. Great views & coffee,1
"Loved this restaurant. When booking,  I asked for a table by the window, and was thrilled on arrival to be seated at a window table. Our waiter Elaine, was absolutely lovely. So helpful. We chose a course from each of the 5 categories, and all were wonderful. Our favourites were the haloumi salad, and the mushrooms. We would have loved dessert, but were all just too full.
My only negative comment concerns the young man behind the bar, who was obviously very stressed as the restaurant was very busy, however he never smiled once. As he was the person who 1st greeted you, a smile would have been appreciated.",1
"Absolutely delicious food, great service and beautiful views. One of the best places Iâve ever eaten",1
"This restaurant is a MUST when dining in the Barossa.  We were running late, rang to advise and they were very accommodating. Choice of two menus was excellent, as some in our party had a late breakfast, so we went with the lighter option.  VERY good value for money.  Wines were mainly from their cellar, but very good.  French champagne reasonably priced for our birthday celebration.  Beautiful views, ample parking, new building and clean toilets - could not fault it.  
Thank you !",1
"Food was delicious,  staff friendly and knowledgeable. There was no rush in serving you and pushing you out the door. It was a very enjoyable experience",1
"Best food, fresh with great flavours. Excellent value for money.",1
"An amazing experience.
Fabulous food, fabulous service and fabulous value.
Highly recommend.",1
We opted to choose our own menu and were impressed by delicious food. The air conditioning wasn't working so a little warm and stuffy however the waitress brought out a fan that helped. Lovely staff and great to have the opportunity to taste Calabria wines as well during our visit,1
"Brilliant! Loved the entire experience. 
 Even provided doggie bags which was great as there was only two of us and sooo much food. We purchased a bottle of wine which was also delicious, but as we were unable to finish it, we were welcome to take the remainder home with us.  One of the best dining experience we have had in some time.",1
"What a wonderful place. Excellent food, very friendly service and beautiful setting. Would love to come back if only we did not live in the UK.",1
"We had the Eat like a Barossan  dinner which gave us chance to enjoy lots of local produce dishes.  Highly recommend I would suggest they offered  a wine pairing with this to complete the experience.  Staff were excellent, views amazing, take a warm top itâs chilly there at night as the balcony has no heaters.",1
"We were recommended to go to Harvest Kitchen from friends.
While the night was ok, the service was lacking.",1
"The food was fabulous & just kept coming! (We had to take some of the last course home as we couldnt finish it all.) The waiting staff were all really engaging & attentive, & had great knowledge of all the dishes they were serving. Beautiful view, particularly as the sun went down. A nice, relaxed atmosphere. Our second visit & we'll definitely go again. Great to find a place that caters to all dietary requirements; all our 6 courses were vegan & were all excellent! Well done to all the staff!! ð",1
Fantastic setting.  The feed me menu had lots of very interesting and tasty dishes.  Very good value.  Staff were really engaging and friendly.  5 Stars!,1
"Wonderful food, friendly staff, value for money and a great wine list.",1
"With excellent views overlooking a vineyard and old gum trees, the service is top-level and the food is scrumptious. Love this place.",1
"Best value, fantastic quality food!  Recommend â feed me like a barossan â",1
"The weather could have been better, so we decided to have an extended lunch at this modern place with normally beautiful view over the vinyards. Had the Barossa menu with a variety of different delicious dishes,  nicely presented and explained by staff. The 2022 Riesling was also very nice and fresh.",1
"Lovely views, amazing food and service. Will definitely return in summer snd sit outside",1
"It was worth the drive down, it was yummy, and the experience was great.",1
One of the best Mediterranean meals I have ever had! Such good value and great staff. Would 100% recommend and will be back.,1
A wonderful food experience overlooking vineyards,1
"Went on a recommendation from the Tanunda Visitor Centre. Had no expectations but wow....wonderful food - share plates chefs choice. Refined and good flavours. Great scenery, warm service, good prices and very adaptable for dietey requirements.
Will definitely be visiting here again. 
Best experienced for 4 or more people per table.",1
"I would recommend dining at Harvest Kitchen, the food, service and view were amazing and also the wine! A must when visiting the Barossa",1
"We would like to thank all of the staff for a lovely time, we both enjoyed our dinner immensely",1
"Very unimpressive food every course serves cold and with fennel, I love seasonal veg but not the same thing in every course, totally zero atmosphere as opposed to last year very disappointing experience wonât be te visiting",0
"Our experience was absolutely fantastic!!  The food (we had the Eat Like a Barossian) was well paced, very fresh and loaded with flavor leaving us very satisfied without being completely stuffed.  The restaurant was very busy but our wait staff were very calm, explaining everything and giving us all the time we needed.  Considering the amount of variety we had the menu was well priced and affordable.
Definitely would go back.",1
"Food was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful.  No hesitation relocated us to
another table that was not being used and one we preferred.",1
"This was just the best food
We had 2 vegetarians and 4 non vegos. All catered for superbly
Could not have asked for anything different
The service was equally excellent.",1
"We frequently visit Harvest Kitchen when in the Barossa. Always outstanding food. The line of acidity throughout the dishes is outstanding, and the balance of salt, fat, sweetness paired with fresh vegetables and meats is stunning for the price. 

When busy some of the finesse that weâve experienced in the food previously sometimes slips, but the service is always fast, friendly and efficient. 

Wonderful place to eat and visit.",1
Delicious food and friendly staff who were more than happy to accommodate for coeliac gluten free requirements. Lovely setting looking across the vineyards.,1
"We had a group of 4 and chose the Feed me Eden selection.  The food was excellent, especially the mushrooms with Brussels Sprouts. The service was helpful and attentive. Our only issue was that it was very noisy. Not sure if it was because of the weather, more people  than usual were inside",1

We had a wonderful experience at Harvest Kitchen. We lunched on the deck overlooking the vines. We had the Feed Me Eden menu. It was hard to say which of the five chosen dishes was the best.

2 couples staying in Tanunda for 4 days - favourite meal by a long way. Not only the best flavours and most interesting selections but best value by a long way. Book ahead and do not miss out on this amazing spot. Thanks to the team at Harvest Kitchen for a great lunch!,1

"You have to ""eat like a Barossan"" when you go here - you won't be disappointed if you do!",1
The food was fabulous. We went early (11:30) and the place was pretty empty. We had booked but they put us right next to pretty much the only other occupied table in the whole place and right outside the bathrooms. Thereâs heaps of good food around so Iâd probably try somewhere else based on that disappointing service.,1
"Every think was ok , the room needs colour , very dull colour less dining room,Bright green artificial plants hanging out of baskets would have helped, vases on tables, it needed something, for a place of that quality a little money needs to be spent on appearance I believe, We eat out every week all around Adelaide and the Hills , and first impressions are very important",1
"Great, great and great. In fact it was excellent. Thanks.",1
We left feeling full to the brim but very satisfied. Would definitely come back and enjoy their feed me,1
"We went for Father's day and it was completely booked, so it was a little noisy. We were seated near the door to the toilets so not ideal position.  However, the food was so good it made up for positioning.  We had the Eat like a Barossian option and every single dish was outstanding. Already making plans to go back!",1
The food was delicious and the service was great. Lovely waiters and werenât waiting long for food. Beautiful view and great vibe overall. We will definitely be back!,1
Eat like a Barossian was a great spread of nice selections. Make sure you pace yourself as there are lots of courses :),1
"Overall we had a very pleasant experience. The food was absolutely delicious and the service we received from everybody was exceptional! The Vegan and Vegetarian dishes were so well made and very very tasty!
It was a shame we weren't allowed to sit outside on the deck, given it was such a beautiful day, so that made it quite noisy inside.",1
Fabulous fresh food and wonderful service. Thank you.,1
